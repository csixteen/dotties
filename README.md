These are some of the configuration files from software that I use on a regular basis. I will be adding more (or changing the existing ones) when it makes sense. Here is a brief description of my setup:

- OS: Gentoo Linux
- Window Manager: i3
- Terminal emulator: URxvt (or `rxvt-unicode`, if you prefer)
- File Manager: Ranger
- Shell: Bash
- Editor: Vim
